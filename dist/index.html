                his crew was annihilated in a storm.</span>
                <span class="zeff-text">As a pirate, Zeff was fierce and uncompromising, willing to rob civilians</span>
                <span class="zeff-text"> without hesitation 
                    and commanding great fear from even his own crew.</span>
                <span class="zeff-text">However, even at this stage he was an idealistic sea cook at heart, believing in the fabled All Blue.</span>
                <span class="zeff-text">Zeff also holds a strong sense of chivalry toward women, believing it a man's duty to spare them all physical harm.</span>
